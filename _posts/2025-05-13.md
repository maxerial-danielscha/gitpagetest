## Implicit Refreshing With Cookies
One huge benefit to storing your JWTs in cookies (when your frontend is a website) is that the frontend does not have to handle any logic when it comes to refreshing a token. It can all happen implicitly with the cookies your Flask application sets.

The basic idea here is that at the end of every request, we will check if there is a JWT that is close to expiring. If we find a JWT that is nearly expired, we will replace the current cookie containing the JWT with a new JWT that has a longer time until it expires.

This is our recommended approach when your frontend is a website.
